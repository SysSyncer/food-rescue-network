Yes, we can start building this project step by step! We already have a clear project overview, so hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

Step-by-Step Development Plan

1. Set Up Project Structure
   â€¢ Create a Next.js project with TypeScript enabled.
   â€¢ Install necessary dependencies (mongoose, next-auth, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, and shadcn/ui).
2. Database Configuration
   â€¢ Set up MongoDB connection (can reuse your connectMongo function).
   â€¢ Create the four MongoDB models (User, FoodDonation, Request, Volunteer).
3. Authentication
   â€¢ Configure NextAuth with a credentials provider.
   â€¢ Implement sign-up and sign-in pages for user roles (donor, volunteer, shelter).
   â€¢ Add role-based JWTs.
4. Role-Based Access Control
   â€¢ Add middleware for role-based route protection.
   â€¢ Ensure that certain actions are accessible only to specific roles (e.g., shelters can request food, volunteers can claim donations).
5. Food Donation Management
   â€¢ Implement a form for donors to create food donation entries.
   â€¢ Allow shelters to request food from the available donations.
   â€¢ Track the status of each donation (available, claimed, delivered).
6. Volunteer Management
   â€¢ Allow volunteers to register their availability and transportation info.
   â€¢ Match volunteers to claimed donations for pickup and delivery.
7. Request Management
   â€¢ Allow shelters to view, create, and fulfill requests.
   â€¢ Implement a matching process for donations and requests.
8. User Dashboard
   â€¢ Create role-specific dashboards for donors, volunteers, and shelters.
   â€¢ Show relevant actions and information based on user roles.
9. UI and Styling
   â€¢ Use ShadCN components to style all pages.
   â€¢ Ensure a clean, user-friendly interface for all interactions.

To design personalized dashboards for donors, volunteers, and shelters, we need to define the specific functionalities and data relevant to each role. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

---

### **1. Donor Dashboard**

**Purpose:** Allows donors to manage their food donations and track their status.

**Frontend Components:**

- **Donation List:** Displays all donations made by the donor.
- **Add Donation Form:** Allows donors to create new donations.
- **Donation Status Tracker:** Shows whether a donation is available, claimed, or delivered.
- **Profile & Settings:** Allows donors to update their information.
- **Analytics (Optional):** Displays donation history and impact.

**API Routes:**

- `GET /api/donations?donor_id=<id>` â†’ Fetch donations created by the donor.
- `POST /api/donations` â†’ Create a new donation.
- `PUT /api/donations/<id>` â†’ Update a donation (e.g., mark it as delivered).
- `DELETE /api/donations/<id>` â†’ Remove a donation.

**Additional Models (If Needed):**

- No major new models required; modifications to `FoodDonation` might be needed.

### **2. Volunteer Dashboard**

**Purpose:** Allows volunteers to view and claim food donations for delivery.

**Frontend Components:**

- **Available Donations List:** Shows donations that need pickup/delivery.
- **Claimed Donations List:** Displays donations the volunteer is responsible for.
- **Pickup & Delivery Status:** Volunteers can update the status of a donation.
- **Profile & Settings:** Volunteers can manage their availability.

**API Routes:**

- `GET /api/donations/available` â†’ Fetch donations available for volunteers.
- `POST /api/volunteers/claim` â†’ Volunteer claims a donation for delivery.
- `PUT /api/donations/<id>/status` â†’ Update donation status (e.g., "in transit").
- `GET /api/volunteers?volunteer_id=<id>` â†’ Fetch donations assigned to a volunteer.

**Additional Models:**

- `VolunteerAssignment`: Tracks which volunteer is handling which donation.
  ```ts
  const VolunteerAssignmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    volunteer_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
      required: true,
    },
    donation_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Food_Donation",
      required: true,
    },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: ["assigned", "in transit", "delivered"],
      default: "assigned",
    },
  });
  ```

---

### **3. Shelter Dashboard**

**Purpose:** Allows shelters to request food donations and manage incoming supplies.

**Frontend Components:**

- **Request Food Donations:** Allows shelters to request specific food items.
- **Assigned Donations List:** Displays donations assigned to the shelter.
- **Received Donations:** A record of past received donations.
- **Profile & Settings:** Manage shelter information.

**API Routes:**

- `POST /api/requests` â†’ Create a new donation request.
- `GET /api/requests?shelter_id=<id>` â†’ Fetch requests made by the shelter.
- `GET /api/donations/assigned?shelter_id=<id>` â†’ Fetch donations assigned to the shelter.
- `PUT /api/requests/<id>` â†’ Update or cancel a request.

**Additional Models:**

- `DonationRequest`: Tracks shelter requests for food.
  ```ts
  const DonationRequestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    shelter_id: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "User",
      required: true,
    },
    food_type: { type: String, required: true },
    quantity: { type: Number, required: true },
    status: {
      type: String,
      enum: ["pending", "fulfilled", "canceled"],
      default: "pending",
    },
  });
  ```

### **Next Steps**

1. Implement the role-based dashboard UI using ShadCN components.
2. Create and connect the necessary API routes for each role.
3. Develop additional models (`VolunteerAssignment`, `DonationRequest`) where necessary.
4. Ensure authentication and role-based access control work correctly.

Would you like to start with one dashboard first (e.g., Donor) and then move to the others? ðŸš€
